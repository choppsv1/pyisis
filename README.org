* A partial implementation of the IS-IS routing protocol.

This is a partial implementation of the IS-IS routing protocol (ISO 10589).

** Features (or lack of):

   Missing items:
   - SPF (Decision process).
   - Point-to-point links.
   - Prefix distribution.
   - Many legacy TLVs (e.g., narrow metrics).
   - Many extension RFCS.

   What's there:
   - Broadcast Link Support.
   - Adjacencies (Hello process).
   - Flooding (Update process).
   - LSP generation (Update process).
   - DIS and non-DIS functionality.

   Sub-optimal impementation points:
   - No flooding dampening.

** Unit tests
   There exists some unit tests for some important parts of the library support
   code. However, there are not tests for the larger procotol
   functionality. This would be very nice to have.
